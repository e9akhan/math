Take the number **192** and multiply it by each of **1**, **2**, **3**:

<h5 style="text-align:center;">192 * 1 = 192</h5>
<h5 style="text-align:center;">192 * 2 = 384</h5>
<h5 style="text-align:center;">192 * 3 = 576</h5>

By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, **192384576**. We will call **192384576** the concatenated product of **192** and **(1, 2, 3)**.

The same can be achieved by starting with **9** and multiplying by **1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, and **5**, giving the pandigital, **918273645**, which is the concatenated product of **9** and **(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)**.

Write a function to find the largest **1** to **9** pandigital **9**-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with **(1, 2, .., n)** where **n > 1**?
