##GoldBach's Other Conjecture

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

<h5 style="text-align:center;">9 = 7 + 2(1)<sup>2</sup></h5>
<h5 style="text-align:center;">15 = 7 + 2(2)<sup>2</sup></h5>
<h5 style="text-align:center;">21 = 3 + 2(3)<sup>2</sup></h5>
<h5 style="text-align:center">25 = 7 + 2(3)<sup>2</sup></h5>
<h5 style="text-align:center">27 = 19 + 2(2)<sup>2</sup></h5>
<h5 style="text-align:center;">33 = 31 + 2(1)<sup>2</sup></h5>

It turns out that the conjecture was false.
