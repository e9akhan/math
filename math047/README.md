The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

<h5 style="text-align:center">14 = 2 * 7</h5>
<h5 style="text-align:center">15 = 3 * 5</h5>
 
The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

<h5 style="text-align:center">644 = 2<sup>2</sup> * 7 * 23</h5>
<h5 style="text-align:center">645 = 3 * 5 * 43</h5>
<h5 style="text-align:center">646 = 2 * 17 * 19</h5>
