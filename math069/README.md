## Totient Maximum

Euler's totient function, $f(n)$ [sometimes called the phi function], is defined as the number of positive integers not exceeding **n** which are relatively prime to **n**. For example, as **1**, **2**, **4**, **5**, **7**, and **8**, are all less than or equal to nine and relatively prime to nine, $f(n) = 6$.
